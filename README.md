# Python-project
## This is my first project using Python3 and Django

I had a lot of practice debugging with this project. A lot of it had to do with the individual Primary Keys being assigned to the wrong things (aka assigned to __"items"__ instead of __"item"__). Rookie mistakes, I know...

----

I was pretty excited to get full CRUD capability going on this and will eventually build it out to be a craigslist clone.

## The languages I used
1. Python3
2. Django
3. PostgreSQL
4. HTML
5. LESS
